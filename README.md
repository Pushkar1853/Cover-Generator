* This is a simple application that uses the spectacular Stable Diffusion model to generate images from song lyrics.

* We apply a large multilingual language model in open-ended generation of English song lyrics, and
evaluate the resulting lyrics for coherence and creativity using
human reviewers. 
* We find that current computational metrics for evaluating large language model outputs
have limitations in evaluation of creative writing. We note
that the human concept of creativity requires lyrics to be
both comprehensible and distinctive ‚Äî and that humans assess certain types of machine-generated lyrics to score more
highly than real lyrics by popular artists.
* Inspired by the inherently multimodal nature of album releases, we leverage
a English-language stable diffusion model to produce high quality lyric-guided album art, demonstrating a creative approach for an artist seeking inspiration for an album or single.

#### How are lyrics transcribed?
This notebook uses openai's recently released 'whisper' model for performing automatic speech recognition. OpenAI was kind enough to offer several different sizes of this model which each have their own pros and cons. This notebook uses the largest whisper model for transcribing the actual lyrics. Additionally, we use the smallest model for performing the lyric segmentation. Neither of these models is perfect, but the results so far seem pretty decent.

* <h3> Chat GPT and GPT-2 models </h3>
* We trained this model using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), using the same methods as InstructGPT, but with slight differences in the data collection setup. We trained an initial model using supervised fine-tuning: human AI trainers provided conversations in which they played both sides‚Äîthe user and an AI assistant. We gave the trainers access to model-written suggestions to help them compose their responses. We mixed this new dialogue dataset with the InstructGPT dataset, which we transformed into a dialogue format.

* To create a reward model for reinforcement learning, we needed to collect comparison data, which consisted of two or more model responses ranked by quality. To collect this data, we took conversations that AI trainers had with the chatbot. We randomly selected a model-written message, sampled several alternative completions, and had AI trainers rank them. Using these reward models, we can fine-tune the model using Proximal Policy Optimization. We performed several iterations of this process.

## Notebooks:
The whole process is divided into three sections:
* <h4> The generation of Lyrics/Transcript from given audio file </h4>  
[For notebook of audio  --->  Lyrics/Transcript](https://github.com/Pushkar1853/Music-Cover-generator/blob/32e4240fadb609a657a8595ebe6d6d396f65cb42/final-baseline/meeting-audio-lyrics.ipynb)

* <h4> The generation of Prompt from the lyrics </h4> 
[For notebook of lyrics  --->  prompt](https://github.com/Pushkar1853/Music-Cover-generator/blob/32e4240fadb609a657a8595ebe6d6d396f65cb42/final-baseline/lyrics-prompt.ipynb)

* <h4> The generation of Stable-diffused image from the Prompt </h4>

Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have madeamazing advances. However, the status quo is to usetext input alone, which can impede controllability. In thiswork, we propose GLIGEN,Grounded-Language-to-ImageGeneration, a novel approach that builds upon and extendsthe functionality of existing pre-trained text-to-image dif-fusion models by enabling them to also be conditioned ongrounding inputs. To preserve the vast concept knowledge ofthe pre-trained model, we freeze all of its weights and injectthe grounding information into new trainable layers via agated mechanism. Our model achieves open-world groundedtext2img generation with caption and bounding box condi-tion inputs, and the grounding ability generalizes well tonovel spatial conÔ¨Ågurations and concepts. GLIGEN‚Äôs zero-shot performance on COCO and LVIS outperforms existingsupervised layout-to-image baselines by a large margin
